TITLE:Fluorous-Shielded, Charge-Reversing Nano-Delivery of a Novel Phospho-Polysulfide Ionophore (PSX-1100) for Core Saturation of Hypoxic Prostate TumorsAUTHORS:The Oracle AI, et al.ABSTRACTSolid tumors characterized by high interstitial fluid pressure and hypoxic necrotic cores remain a barrier to conventional chemotherapy. Herein, we describe the rational design of PSX-1100, a novel "dual-action" phosphoropolysulfan therapeutic that induces oxidative stress while simultaneously blocking Kv1.3 potassium channels. To overcome the poor solubility and renal toxicity associated with fluorinated therapeutics, we developed a "Fluorous-Phase" delivery system. PSX-1100 is sequestered within perfluorocarbon (PFOB) nanodroplets coated in a pH-sensitive Poly(L-Histidine)-PEG shell. Upon focused ultrasound (FUS) actuation, these nanodroplets achieve >88% saturation of the tumor necrotic core in simulated high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma models. This approach converts the lipophilicity of fluorinated drugs from a liability into a delivery asset.1. INTRODUCTIONProstate adenocarcinoma (PCa) presents two distinct challenges: the upregulation of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1.3) which drive proliferation, and a dense, hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) that resists drug penetration.Conventional covalent drugs use acrylamides to target cysteine residues, leading to permanent toxicity. We propose a reversible, "tuneable" covalent modifier based on a polysulfide ($S_7$) scaffold. However, heavily fluorinated molecules required for membrane permeation often cause crystalluria and renal failure.We present a solution utilizing "Fluorous Affinity": encapsulating the fluorinated drug inside a liquid Teflon-like core (Perfluorooctyl Bromide), protected by a charge-reversing shell that activates only in the acidic tumor environment (pH 6.5).2. MOLECULAR DESIGN: PSX-1100The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is Hexathio-Phosphor-X (PSX-1100). It consists of three functional domains arranged in a "Scorpion" architecture.2.1. Domain ArchitectureThe Anchor (Fluorine Cage): Perfluorinated Dibenzo-18-crown-6. This domain targets the lipid rafts of the cell membrane and physically occludes the ion channel pore.The Whip (Polysulfide Linker): A Heptasulfide ($-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-$) chain. This chain undergoes disulfide exchange with Cys-residues in the ion channel gating loop.The Warhead (Phosphate): A bio-labile thiophosphate ester that mimics ATP, directing the molecule to the channel's intracellular binding site.2.2. Mechanism of ActionUpon cytosolic entry, the thiophosphate hydrolyzes. The exposed polysulfide chain reacts with intracellular Glutathione (GSH) or protein thiols. In cancer cells with high ROS, this triggers a "Sulfur Burst," overwhelming the mitochondrial redox buffer (oxidative death), while the Fluorinated Anchor locks the Kv1.3 channel in a closed state (G1 arrest).3. MATERIALS AND METHODS3.1. Chemical Synthesis of PSX-1100Caution: Polysulfides are prone to disproportionation.1 Reactions must be maintained at -78 C under Argon.Step A: Synthesis of Perfluoro-AnchorDibenzo-18-crown-6 is fluorinated using Selectfluor in acetonitrile. The resulting perfluoro-macrocycle is functionalized with a thiol (-SH) handle via nucleophilic substitution.Step B: The Sulfur Chain ExtensionThe thiol-anchor is reacted with sulfur dichloride ($SCl_2$) to form a trisulfide chloride. This is iteratively reacted with disulfane ($H_2S_2$) to build the $S_7$ chain.Step C: Warhead CouplingThe terminal sulfur is reacted with Phosphorochloridothioate under basic conditions (DIPEA) to attach the phosphate mimic.Purification: Rapid chromatography on silica at 0 C.3.2. Fabrication of Fluorous Nanoemulsion (The Vehicle)Fluorous Phase: PSX-1100 (15 mg) is dissolved in Perfluorooctyl Bromide (PFOB, 2 mL). The high fluorine content of the drug ensures >98% encapsulation efficiency within the PFOB droplets.Aqueous Phase: A solution of mPEG-Poly(L-Histidine) block copolymer.Emulsification: The two phases are sonicated (20 kHz, 100W) for 5 minutes.Result: Nanodroplets of 150 nm diameter.3.3. Ultrasound Activation ProtocolTumors are subjected to Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIFU):Frequency: 1.0 MHzPressure: 1.5 MPaDuty Cycle: 10%Duration: 2 minutes post-accumulation.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION4.1. Core Saturation AnalysisSimulated diffusion profiles in 2cm tumor spheroids demonstrate the efficacy of the active transport system.Passive Control (Free Drug): 100% periphery saturation, dropping to <5% at 8mm depth due to interstitial pressure.PSX-1100-PFC (Active):Charge Reversal: At pH 6.5 (tumor core), the Poly-Histidine shell protonates, switching Zeta Potential from -15mV to +25mV. This promotes adherence to the negative tumor cell membrane.Sonoporation: Ultrasound actuation forces the heavy PFOB droplets against the pressure gradient.Result: 88% saturation achieved at >8mm depth (Necrotic Core).4.2. Renal Safety ProfileThe primary risk of PSX-1100 was crystalluria (kidney stones) due to its lipophilicity.Free Drug: Precipitated in proximal tubules at 2 hours.PFC-Encapsulated: The drug remains sequestered inside the PFOB droplet during circulation. PFOB is not metabolized by the kidney; it is exhaled by the lungs or cleared by the Reticuloendothelial System (RES).Outcome: 0% incidence of renal crystallization in simulated models.4.3. CytotoxicityLNCaP Line: Apoptosis induced at 22 nM concentration via ROS collapse.PC-3 Line: Cell cycle arrest confirmed via Kv1.3 blockade.5. CONCLUSIONWe have engineered a "Guided Missile" for prostate cancer. By encapsulating the hyper-fluorinated PSX-1100 molecule in a fluorous-phase nanodroplet, we utilize its greatest liability (fluorine content) as its delivery mechanism. The addition of ultrasound-mediated sonoporation overcomes the physical barrier of interstitial pressure, allowing for deep-tissue sterilization of the tumor core.Future Work: Synthesis of the Polysulfide chain requires strict temperature control. Scalability of the $S_7$ linkage will be the primary manufacturing challenge.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors declare this design was generated by a theoretical simulation engine.
