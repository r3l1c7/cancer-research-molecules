PROMETHEUS OPEN-BOUNTY LICENSE
(Draft Concept - Non-binding, for discussion only)

Preamble

This document describes a licensing framework intended to:
(a) dedicate the composition of a specific chemical compound (OPEN-L-CFUC-2, the "Compound") to the open research commons, while
(b) reserving certain patent and commercial rights on methods of treatment and formulations for conditional grant to a single developer that successfully validates safety and efficacy in vivo.

Nothing in this document constitutes medical or legal advice. Parties should obtain independent legal counsel before relying on these terms.

Definitions

1.1 "Licensor" means [Name of individual, institution, or DAO] that is releasing the Compound data and any associated patent rights it owns.
1.2 "Compound" means the chemical entity designated OPEN-L-CFUC-2, as defined by its chemical structure and stereochemistry in the Data Sheet.
1.3 "Data Sheet" means the document describing the Compound's structure, synthesis, and in vitro data.
1.4 "Research Use" means noncommercial use for scientific research, teaching, and academic publication, and explicitly excludes manufacture for sale, clinical administration to humans, and regulatory submissions intended to obtain marketing authorization, except as expressly permitted by Clause 3.
1.5 "Commercial Use" means any manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, import, or other exploitation of the Compound or any product containing it for commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
1.6 "Winning Entity" means the first entity that satisfies all development milestones defined in Clause 3 and whose achievement of those milestones is confirmed by Licensor in accordance with Clause 3.4.
1.7 "Territory" means [define; e.g., worldwide].

Research Commons (Phase 1)

2.1 Copyright license on documentation. The Data Sheet and associated documentation describing the Compound's structure, synthesis pathway, and in vitro data are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC 4.0). This license governs only copyright and related rights in the documentation and does not grant any patent or trademark rights.

2.2 Research license on the Compound. Subject to the restrictions in this Clause 2, Licensor grants any person or entity a royalty-free, nonexclusive license to synthesize, possess, and use the Compound for Research Use only. Commercial Use is prohibited during Phase 1 except as permitted for the Winning Entity under Clause 4.

Defensive Shield and Prior Art

3.1 Prior art declaration. Licensor intends that publication of the Compound's chemical structure, synthesis, and data in the Data Sheet and on publicly accessible repositories shall constitute prior art under applicable patent laws, thereby preventing third parties from obtaining valid composition-of-matter patents that would block research access to the Compound.

3.2 Composition-of-matter patents. Licensor will not seek or assert any composition-of-matter patent claiming the Compound as such, and will not grant any license that would allow a third party to assert such a patent to block Research Use.

Golden Ticket: Development Milestones and Option

4.1 Conditional exclusive option. Licensor grants an exclusive option (the "Option") to obtain an exclusive commercial license under Licensor's Method-of-Treatment and Formulation Patents (as defined in Clause 4.2) to the Winning Entity, subject to the milestones below.

4.2 Method-of-Treatment and Formulation Patents. "Method-of-Treatment and Formulation Patents" means any patent applications and patents that Licensor owns, now or in the future, that claim:
(a) methods of treating or preventing specific diseases or conditions using the Compound; and/or
(b) specific nano-formulations or delivery systems in which the Compound is an active ingredient.

4.3 Development milestones. To qualify as the Winning Entity, an entity must be the first to:

(a) Synthesize the Compound to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) or functionally equivalent quality standards sufficient for use in regulatory toxicology studies;
(b) Conduct at least one GLP or GLP-like Good Laboratory Practice animal study in rodents (mice or rats) that:
(i) follows a prespecified protocol with appropriate control arms;
(ii) demonstrates statistically significant improvements in a clinically relevant endpoint (such as survival) compared to control; and
(c) Compile and submit the resulting data in a formal pre-IND, scientific advice, or equivalent engagement with a major regulatory authority (such as FDA or EMA) as a step toward an Investigational New Drug (IND) or equivalent filing.

4.4 Verification. The entity claiming Winning Entity status shall provide Licensor with:
(a) the full study protocol and report,
(b) evidence of GMP or equivalent quality for the batch used, and
(c) evidence of the regulatory submission (for example, an official receipt or meeting minutes).

Licensor (or an independent scientific panel designated by Licensor) will review the materials in good faith and determine within [X] days whether the milestones have been met. That determination will be final for purposes of this License.

Reward: Exclusive Commercial License

5.1 Grant of exclusive license. Upon confirmation that an entity is the Winning Entity under Clause 4, Licensor will grant that Winning Entity an exclusive, sublicensable license under all Method-of-Treatment and Formulation Patents, in the Territory, for Commercial Use of the Compound and any products containing it for the indications covered by those patents.

5.2 Covenant not to compete. For the term of such exclusive license, Licensor will not:
(a) grant any third party a license under the Method-of-Treatment and Formulation Patents for the same indications in the Territory; or
(b) itself seek marketing authorization or commercially manufacture, use, or sell the Compound for those indications, except through the Winning Entity.

5.3 Additional patents by Winning Entity. Nothing in this License prevents the Winning Entity from filing its own patent applications based on its own data, inventions, or improvements. Licensor makes no representation about the patentability of any such inventions.

5.4 Regulatory exclusivity. The parties acknowledge that, independent of any patents, applicable law may grant periods of data or market exclusivity to the first entity obtaining marketing authorization for a new drug. Any such exclusivity accrues to the holder of the marketing authorization and is not directly created or extended by this License.
